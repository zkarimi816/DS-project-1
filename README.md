# DS-project-1

For this project, I have utilized the World Development Indicators Dataset, focusing on two crucial 
indicators: the Labor force participation rate, which represents the percentage of the total population aged 
15 and above participating in the labor force (national estimate), and GDP per capita (constant 2010 US$) 
of Japan. The analysis spans from 1960 to 2020, providing valuable insights into Japan's economic and 
labor force dynamics over six decades.

The research question at hand, "Is there a relationship between Labor force participation and GDP per 
capita in Japan?" is not merely a matter of academic curiosity; it delves into the heart of Japan's economic 
well-being and societal dynamics. This inquiry bears immense relevance, touching the lives of individuals, 
influencing communities, and shaping the direction of economic policies. Understanding the connection 
between labor force participation—reflecting the active engagement of the population in the workforce—
and GDP per capita, a measure of average income and living standards, holds the key to unraveling 
Japan's economic health. 
Insights derived from this research can empower policymakers with the knowledge to make informed 
decisions, provide guidance on enhancing living standards, and contribute to the economic prosperity of 
the nation. As we embark on this journey of discovery, we aim to shed light on this intricate relationship 
and uncover the insights that have the potential to positively impact Japan's future.

We employed statistical correlation and histograms to explore this relationship. The negative slope of the line 
graph indicates a strong negative correlation between these two indicators, with a correlation coefficient of approximately -0.8691, signifying a robust negative linear relationship. In simpler terms, as GDP per capita rises, labor force participation tends to decline, and conversely, when GDP per capita falls, labor force participation tends to rise. This close-to -1 correlation coefficient underscores the strength of this negative relationship. In practical terms, it suggests that when Japan's economic well-being (GDP per capita) improves, a smaller percentage of the population tends to be part of the labor force. Conversely, during economic downturns, as GDP per capita decreases, more people may join or rejoin the labor force.
